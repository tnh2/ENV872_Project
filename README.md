## Summary

This repository contains data on COVID-19 cases in all of the US Counties, collected from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. It also contains TIGER census data for each county from the US Government, and a shapefile containing geographic information on all of the active coal mines in the US from the US Department of Energy. Accompanying this raw data is R code to perform a geospatial analysis exlporing whether counties with coal mines experience different COVID-19 case rates and death rates than other similar counties. Of particular interest are counties in Pennsylavania (where mines ceased operation due to COVID-19) and West Virginia (where mine operation has continued).

## Database Information

COVID-19 cases and deaths information at a county level come from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. Currently, the data being used is from April 2, 2020. However, this data may be updated closer to the project completion date, and capability to pull live data from the database might be added to the code.

GIS information for the operating surface and underground coal mines in the United States comes from the US Energy Information Administration. This data was published January 18, 2019 and accessed April 2, 2020.

## Folder structure, file formats, and naming conventions 

Folders:
/Code: RMarkdown scripts used to assemble report and analyze data

/Data
  /Raw: contains the raw data downloaded from the sites listed above
    /Spatial: contains raw spatial/shapefile files
  /Processed: contains processed data outputs from analysis scripts
    /Spatial: contains processed spatial/shapefile files
  /Metadata: contains any metadata documents describing the data in other folders
  
/Ouputs
  /Images: Graphical outputs (e.g., maps)
  /Tables: Formatted tables produced in script

/Report: Final compiled report

Files:
- Numerical data (e.g., Populations, COVID19 rates): these files are .csv comma-separated files

- Geospatial (e.g., county boundaries, mine locations): these files are .shp shapefiles, which include support files with the following extensions: .cpg, .dbf, .prj, .sbn., .sbx., .shx.

- R Markdown (e.g., report): these files are .rmd files that can be run in R Studio using R Markdown

File Naming Convention: File names will contain a descriptive title at the beginning, with words separated by underscores or abutted with capital letters. For files produced during analysis, this descriptor will be followed by an underscore and the process that was performed on it (for example, Example_File_cleaned.csv or ExampleFile_map.pdf).
